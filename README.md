# 📊 Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients

Welcome to the **Linear Regression Training Project**. This repository is part of our Machine Learning class and is intended to help students understand and practice **Linear Regression** using a real-world dataset.

---

## 🧠 Objective

In this project, you will explore an **Ecommerce customer dataset** and help a company decide whether to focus on improving their **mobile app** or **website** experience—using data-driven insights powered by Linear Regression.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

We use a dataset from **Kaggle**, which contains information about customer behavior, including:

- **Avg. Session Length** — Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
- **Time on App** — Average time spent on the app (in minutes).
- **Time on Website** — Average time spent on the website (in minutes).
- **Length of Membership** — Number of years the customer has been a member.
- **Yearly Amount Spent** — Target variable we want to predict.

> 📌 **Note:** The dataset should be downloaded separately from Kaggle and added to the project directory.

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

- How to load and explore a real-world dataset
- Apply **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² and MAE
- Interpret regression coefficients to support decision-making

## 🧪 Your Task

After completing the tutorial notebook, try to:

1. **Create your own use case.**
   - Think of another real-world scenario where Linear Regression can be applied.
   - Build a similar model and interpret your results.

2. **Document your findings.**
   - Write clear conclusions based on your model.
   - Include visuals if needed (e.g., scatter plots, regression lines).

3. **Share your project in class.**
   - Be prepared to explain your use case and how Linear Regression helped.
